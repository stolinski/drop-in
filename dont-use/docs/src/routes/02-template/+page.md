# The Base Template

The base template for Drop In includes everything you need to get started with a Pocketbase app. By default you get access to authentication, ssr for landing pages and csr for app pages.

Templates in Drop In are mostly entirely contained in your own local files. Meaning if you don't like something, you have full control to change it. Drop In is just a starter for you to drop into your new app and get rolling.
