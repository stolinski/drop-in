# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Users are experiencing frequent unexpected logouts when using the Drop In application. The issue appears to be bugs in the existing authentication system - users report being logged out every time they use the app, suggesting there are problems with how JWT tokens and cookies are being handled. The goal is to identify and fix the specific bugs causing this behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to stay logged in when I refresh the page or return to the app, so that I don't have to log in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN their JWT cookie SHALL be properly set and readable
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN their authentication state SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN a user returns to the app THEN they SHALL remain logged in if their session is still valid
4. WHEN there are authentication errors THEN they SHALL be clearly logged for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify what's causing users to be logged out, so that I can fix the specific bugs in the authentication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JWT tokens are created or validated THEN the process SHALL be logged with relevant details
2. WHEN cookies are set or read THEN the operations SHALL be logged for debugging
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the specific failure reason SHALL be captured and logged
4. WHEN Zero Sync authentication occurs THEN any errors SHALL be logged with context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want logout to work properly when I choose to log out, so that I'm actually signed out of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN all authentication cookies SHALL be properly cleared
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN their refresh token SHALL be invalidated on the server
3. WHEN logout completes THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the login page
4. WHEN logout fails THEN the error SHALL be logged and handled gracefully
