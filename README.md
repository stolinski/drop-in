4. Set ENV credentials
5. (optional). `npm run typegen` || `pnpm typegen` must have all env credentials set to work

### FAQ

#### What is Zero?

Zero Sync is the local first platform of your dreams. https://zero.rocicorp.dev/ utilizing Zero Svelte, Drop In is able to load data locally while syncing to your database in the backend.

#### Why no authenticated SSR?

The base template has two main route paths. SSR based with no auth or app code with auth. While you could have authenticated user data there are enough major differences in approach (ie not using server actions, cookie for auth token, .server.ts files, ect..) that having both in this codebase felt like it would make it too complex. Might make a 2nd template with full SSR.

#### Why no (insert styling library) included?

It's pretty trivial to add those yourself and I wanted to keep this as bare as possible style wise. Many projects have their own CSS needs and I want to respect that. I'd like to add a cli with alternate builds of this with more baked in UI if anyone is interested in helping.
