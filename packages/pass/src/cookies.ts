// Cookie options
// These are the options for the cookies that are set by the server
// We should make them configurable with the global config.

// I'm wondering if we should have it longer, like a week. LMK what you think.

// Used for the refresh token
// Longer maxAge, currently at 60 days. I dunno, when I think about mobile apps,
// If I go to use them after 60 days, they don't usually make me sign in again.
// But maybe they do, LMK what you think.

// This is the jwt access token, it's very short lived, like 1 week.
// Could be shorter. See above note.
