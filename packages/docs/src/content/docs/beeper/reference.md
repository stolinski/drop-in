## What is it?

Beeper is a lightweight wrapper around NodeMailer that connects to `@drop-in/pass` so that user verification and messages work. It also allows for easy setup via `drop-in.config.js`.

You can use any other email client at any point if you'd like for generally sending emails or you can import and use Beeper on the serverside.
