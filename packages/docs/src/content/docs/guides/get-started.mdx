---

import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Create a new Drop In Project

   <Tabs syncKey="pkg">

   <TabItem label="npm">

   ```sh
   npx @drop-in/new
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="pnpm">

   ```sh
   pnpx @drop-in/new
   ```

   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

2. Install package

3. Create Postgres DB

   Either get connection string, or spin up a local PG db.

4. Start Docker

5. Add Required ENV vars

   ```env
   # This is the server of the local zero cache server, usually will be http://127.0.0.1:4848 unless you have changed it.
   PUBLIC_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:4848

   # Database URL, should be your postgres database
   DATABASE_URL=""

   # \* These must be the same so that zero can verify the JWT
   # \* Generate a random string.
   JWT_SECRET=""
   ZERO_JWT_SECRET=""

   # \* These are needed for Zero Cache
   # In the future we will support other types of upstreams besides PG
   ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB = ""

   # A separate Postgres database we use to store CVRs. CVRs (client view records)
   # keep track of which clients have which data. This is how we know what diff to
   # send on reconnect. It can be same database as above, but in production it
   # can make sense to have it be separate to scale them seperately.
   ZERO_CVR_DB = ""

   # Yet another Postgres database which we used to store a replication log.
   ZERO_CHANGE_DB = ""

   # Uniquely identifies a single instance of the zero-cache service.
   REPLICA_ID = "r1"

   # Place to store the SQLite data zero-cache maintains. This can be lost, but if
   # it is, zero-cache will have to re-replicate next time it starts up.
   ZERO_REPLICA_FILE = "/tmp/dropin-sync-replica.db"

   # Logging level for zero-cache service.
   ZERO_LOG_LEVEL = "debug"
   ```

6. Start the app

   <Tabs syncKey="start">

   <TabItem label="npm">

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="pnpm">

   ```sh
   pnpm start
   ```

   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

</Steps>

Do you have an idea on how to make this all smoother? Are you a Docker pro who wants to tune up our docker-compose.yml, please submit a PR.
